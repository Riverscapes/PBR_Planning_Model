- Off-Channel Rearing Habitat
- Forage Area




## Riparian Wetland Corridor 

The Riparian Wetland Corridor represents the lowest lying areas within the valley bottom that are most likely to be reconnected post-restoration. HAND is used to highlight these low-lying areas; this is done by extracting a 0.5 - 1m contour polygon from the raster itself. This gives us a baseline of what will likely be able to flood after restoration has occured. Google imagery is then used to manually refine the polygon by examining other lines of evidence such as oxbows, abandoned channels or areas of inundation that could be indicative of other low-lying areas that fall outside of the extracted contours.
