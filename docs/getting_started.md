## RAVE

The PBR model is compatible with the Riverscapes Analysis Viewer and Explorer (RAVE). RAVE 
allows users to add data into their preferred GIS with meaningful layer order and symbology.
Currently, there are three versions of RAVE - QRAVE for QGIS, ArcRAVE for ArcMap, and 
WebRAVE. More information and installation instructions can be found at the following links. 

- QRAVE: https://rave.riverscapes.net/Download/install_qrave.html
- ArcRAVE: https://rave.riverscapes.net/Download/install_arcrave.html
- WebRAVE: https://rave.riverscapes.net/Download/install_webrave.html

## Data Acquisition 

1. Before being able to access data from the Riverscapes Warehouse, users will first need 
to create an account. Instructions on creating a Riverscapes Warehouse account can be
found here: https://riverscapes.net/Data_Warehouses/#riverscape-warehouseconcepts.

2. Once an account has been created navigate to https://data.riverscapes.net/#/UKUSFWS
and select PBR from the Project Type dropdown. From here you can download the
model by selecting the <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/download.PNG" width="50">  icon or view it via WebRAVE using the <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/view.PNG" width="50">  icon.

## Data Visualization 

Once RAVE has been installed and the model has been downloaded, you can add the data to a 
map by using the RAVE toolbar.
